# Prerequisites

1. Install node (v6.5.0 or higher)
2. `npm i`

## Running Specs

`npm run test` or `npm run test -- --watch`

## Running solution
1. Uncomment the example in `absences.js`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. A file should be created inside `src/invites` (this takes a short while as it happens asynchronously)

## Yet to finish
* For the JS solution, I am yet to finish writing tests that check for file creation
